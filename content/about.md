- I work as a compiler developer in the [IBM] Toronto lab.
- I am in my final year of undergraduate studies in math at the [University of Toronto.][UofT]

## My Work
I am currently employed as a software developer at [IBM], where I work on the open-source [LLVM] compiler
infrastructure.
I have been involved in projects spanning the areas of [loop optimization,][a1] [loop vectorization,][a2] [register allocation,][a3] and [PowerPC][a4] enablement.

## my studies
I am currently doing supervised independent study courses
- on the [Penrose singularity theorems][b1] with [Stefanos Aretakis](https://www.math.toronto.edu/aretakis/)
- on [minimal surfaces][b2] and [mean curvature flow][b3] with [Robert Hasslhofer](http://www.math.toronto.edu/roberth/)
- on [symplectic geometry][b4] with [Lisa Jeffrey](http://www.math.toronto.edu/~jeffrey/)
- on [random walks][b5] on groups with [Giulio Tiozzo](http://www.math.toronto.edu/tiozzo/)


And this Fall
- on [representation theory][b8] with [Joel Kamnitzer](http://www.math.toronto.edu/jkamnitz/)
- on [algebraic number theory][b6] and [elliptic curves][b7] with [Camelia Karimian Pour](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/cms/camelia-karimian-pour)

I am intending to pursue graduate studies in math starting in the Fall of 2021.
